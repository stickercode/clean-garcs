sequencing.py — Adaptive item-selection engine for GARCS.

Given a student's three SkillState objects (literal/inferential/critical),
this module decides which skill + difficulty to serve next, then picks an
unanswered Question row matching that (skill_tag, difficulty).

This is the "adaptive sequencing" half of Chapter 3.6 — mastery.py estimates
*what the student knows*; this module decides *what to show them next*. In
knowledge-tracing terms, mastery.py is the student model, this is the
policy/tutor layer that consumes it (analogous to how a BKT- or PFA-based
ITS uses its mastery estimate to drive item selection, e.g. "mastery
learning" cutoffs in Cognitive Tutor-style systems).
