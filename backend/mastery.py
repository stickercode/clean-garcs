"""
mastery.py — Rule-based, PFA-inspired student mastery model for GARCS.

Knowledge-tracing lineage
-------------------------
This module is a simplified, interpretable cousin of Performance Factors
Analysis (PFA) (Pavlik, Cen & Koedinger, 2009). Classic PFA fits a logistic
regression per skill j from LOGGED data:

    m(i, j) = beta_j + gamma_j * s_i,j + rho_j * f_i,j
    p(correct) = 1 / (1 + e^-m)

where s_i,j / f_i,j are a student's running counts of prior successes/
failures on skill j, beta_j is the skill's baseline easiness, and gamma_j /
rho_j are learned weights for how much a success/failure moves the needle.

GARCS's MVP has no logged data yet to fit beta/gamma/rho, so this module
replaces the *fitted* logistic weights with *fixed, hand-set* step sizes
(BASE_STEP, DIFF_WEIGHT) and represents the running estimate directly as a
mastery probability in [0, 1] rather than a logit. It keeps PFA's two core
ideas — (1) mastery is a per-skill running estimate, (2) it moves up on
success and down on failure, scaled by item difficulty — while dropping the
statistical fitting step. See the "Upgrade path" note at the bottom for how
to swap in a real fitted PFA model once you have pilot response logs.

# --- Upgrade path: swap in a fitted PFA model later -------------------------
#
# Once you have pilot Response logs (student_id, skill_tag, is_correct,
# difficulty, timestamp), you can fit real PFA parameters per skill with:
#
#   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
#   # features per (student, skill, attempt-so-far): [prior_successes, prior_failures]
#   # target: is_correct
#   model = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)   # learns gamma_j, rho_j; intercept ~ beta_j
#
# Then replace update_mastery's fixed step with:
#   m = beta_j + gamma_j * successes_so_far + rho_j * failures_so_far
#   mastery = 1 / (1 + exp(-m))
#
# This turns the "PFA-inspired" label in Chapter 3 into an actual fitted PFA
# model — worth flagging as a "Recommendations for future work" item in
# Chapter 5 if you don't have enough pilot data to fit it reliably within
# your thesis timeline (PFA needs a reasonable number of responses per skill
# per student to fit gamma/rho without overfitting).
