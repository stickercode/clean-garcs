"""
seed.py — Seeds the GARCS database with starter content: passages tagged
with a grade_band, and questions tagged with skill_tag (literal/inferential/
critical) and difficulty (easy/medium/hard), per Chapter 3.6.3.

Place this file in the same folder as your Phase 1 app.py and run:
    python seed.py

Grade-band convention used here (keep this consistent with your Chapter 3
write-up so it's documented somewhere):
    grade_band 1 -> Grades 5-6
    grade_band 2 -> Grades 7-8
    grade_band 3 -> Grades 9-10

Re-running this script is safe: it clears existing Passage/Question rows
first, so you won't get duplicates every time you re-seed during dev.

This gives you 6 passages x 3 questions = 18 questions, with at least one
question in every (skill_tag, difficulty) combination -- so
sequencing.pick_next_question() always has at least one candidate no
matter which skill/difficulty the engine targets. This is a STARTER set.
Your roadmap's target for a real pilot is 15-25 passages x 3-5 questions
each -- keep adding entries to PASSAGES below using the same structure.

Content note: these passages/questions were drafted for engineering
purposes (to give the adaptive engine real data to run against). Before
your pilot, it's worth having a reading/curriculum-literate reviewer (your
adviser, a co-author, or a teacher) sanity-check wording and grade-level
appropriateness -- content validity matters for a reading comprehension
thesis in a way that's hard for me to fully verify from here.

            "body": "One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons \"capitals of industry\" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel \"robber barons\", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth.\nThe early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large.\nAs the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business.\nThere were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines.\nOver the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.",
